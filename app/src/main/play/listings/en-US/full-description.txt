Funkwhale for Android™ is an Android client for Funkwhale, a music streaming server that you can self-host. It uses Funkwhale's native API instead of the subsonic API.

This app requires an account on a Funkwhale instance to work.

You can get support or take a part in Funkwhale's development by visiting our Gitlab project. You can also join us on Matrix.
