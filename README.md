# Funkwhale for Android™

This is a continuation of the official Android music player for [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio), native to both Android (developed in Kotlin) and to Funkwhale (uses its native API instead of Subsonic).
Since I do not know Kotlin, I have decided to use this as a playground for vibecoding with Google's Gemini agentic mode that is available for free
in Android Studio. As such, there will probably be bugs and quirks. I'm fine with it but you will have to make your own decision.

I am having Gemini implement features that I want to see, such as Android Auto support. All commits from me that were coded by Gemini will be tagged `[Gemini]`. Feel free to submit your own PRs (whether vibecoded or not); I will merge them if I like them.

If you have a problem with this version of the app, please leave an issue rather than bothering the official Funkwhale for Android Matrix channel.

There are no builds available at the moment. I suggest you install Android Studio to build the app for your phone at this time.
