# Funkwhale for Android™

This is a continuation of the official Android music player for [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio), native to both Android (developed in Kotlin) and to Funkwhale (uses its native API instead of Subsonic).
Since I do not know Kotlin, I have decided to use this as a playground for vibecoding with various vibecoding tools that I have free access to. As such, there will probably be bugs and quirks. I'm fine with
it but you will have to make your own decision.

I am having AI implement features that I want to see, such as Android Auto support. All commits from me that were coded by AI will be tagged as such in the commit message or have the AI as a commit author.
Feel free to submit your own PRs (whether vibecoded or not); I will merge them if I like them.

If you have a problem with this version of the app, please leave an issue rather than bothering the official Funkwhale for Android Matrix channel.

There are no builds available at the moment. I suggest you install Android Studio to build the app for your phone at this time.
