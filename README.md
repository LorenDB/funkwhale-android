# Funkwhale for Android

This is based on the amazing [Otter](https://github.com/apognu/otter) made by
[apognu](https://github.com/apognu). This project wouldn't be possible without his groundwork!

This is the official and native Android music player for [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio), native to both Android (developed in Kotlin) and to Funkwhale (uses its native API instead of Subsonic).

You can get help and discuss Funkwhale on Matrix on [#funkwhale-android:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#funkwhale-android:matrix.org).

## State

This is work in Progress. Please bear with it, there **will** be bugs, there **will** be crashes and there **will** be performance or UX issues.

Here is the list of Funkwhale for Android features:

 * Basic collection browsing (artists, albums and tracks)
 * Playlists listing
 * Favorites management (listing and add/remove)
 * Track search
 * Queue management
 * Caching of played tracks (played tracks work offline)
 * Download tracks for offline playback
 * Radios playback
 * Dark mode! 🎉

Funkwhale for Android will try to behave as you would expect a mobile music player to. That means it integrates with the OS's media controls (including headset controls) or pause on incoming calls. If there is anything you would like it to do, please [open an issue](https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale-android/-/issues/new).
